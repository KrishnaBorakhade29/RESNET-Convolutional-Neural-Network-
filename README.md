# ResNet (Convolutional Neural Network)
ResNet (Residual Network) is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing residual connections. These connections allow the model to skip one or more layers, making it easier to train very deep networks. ResNet has been highly successful in tasks like image classification, winning the 2015 ImageNet competition. It is known for its ability to effectively train networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers, improving performance without overfitting.
